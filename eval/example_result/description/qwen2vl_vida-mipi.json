This effect reduces the clarity and smoothness of the smoke's edges, making them appear less natural and more pixelated. The affected area quality is good, but it is essential to the overall quality of the image.\nThe <|object_ref_start|>moderate edge aliasing effect<|object_ref_end|><|box_start|>(19,189),(983,971)<|box_end|> in the upper-right corner significantly impacts the overall image quality. The jagged edges disrupt the natural flow and smoothness of the smoke, which is a key element of the image's artistic effect. Despite the good quality of the affected region, the essential role of this area in the composition means that the distortion has a notable impact on the viewer's perception. The image's low-level attributes, such as color contrast and dynamic composition, are otherwise well-preserved, but the edge aliasing effect detracts from the intended smoothness and fluidity of the smoke patterns.\nThus, the quality of the image is fair.<|im_end|>"
